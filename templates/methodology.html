<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>
    Fill in the simulation settings on the left (deck size, initial hand size, number of draw steps, number of
    simulations, and random seed). Then, paste your deck list in the provided text area. The deck list should include
    a "Deck" section (which will be simulated) and a "Sideboard" section (which will be ignored).
    Finally, click “Run simulation” to start and view the results.
</p>

<p>
    To get your deck list from 17lands, click on the "Deck Export" button from the deck view and
    select "Copy as plain text" and then paste into this app accordingly.
</p>

<h3>How the simulation works</h3>
<p>
    The simulation runs many iterations of a simplified game scenario. For each simulation:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Your deck list is parsed and each card name is converted to its mana requirements and production capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>For each simulation run, a deck is built from the parsed deck list and shuffled.</li>
    <li>For each turn in the simulation, the hand size increases (depending on “on play” or “on draw” rules), and the
        simulation checks which spells are “dead” (i.e. not castable) based on mana-producing cards (lands or cards that
        tap for
        mana) that could have been “played” in previous turns.</li>
    <li>We also record how many spells are uncastable specifically because they are missing certain color pips. We
        only count these as “missing color” if the total cost is within the number of lands available. That means
        if the spell costs 3 total mana but we have 3 lands, we check if we have the correct colored sources. If
        not, we say it’s “dead due to missing color(s).”</li>
    <li>Results are aggregated across simulations and displayed as summary statistics and charts.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key Assumptions in the Simulation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fixed Turn Structure:</strong> We assume a fixed number of turns and a set increase in hand size
        depending on the “on play” vs. “on draw” scenario.</li>
    <li><strong>One Mana per Land:</strong> Each land or mana-producing source is assumed to provide exactly one mana
        (of one color from its producible colors) per turn.</li>
    <li><strong>Simplified Casting:</strong> The simulation tries to see if a spell can be cast by checking all possible
        combinations of the available sources up to the number of lands playable that turn.</li>
    <li><strong>No Re-check for Known Castables:</strong> Once a normal spell is deemed castable, we consider it
        castable in subsequent turns without further checks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interpreting the Key Statistics</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>% of Turns with 0 Dead Spells:</strong> This statistic shows the proportion of simulated turns in which
        every spell drawn could be cast.</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Dead Spells per Turn:</strong> This is the average number of spells per turn that are “dead.”
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Read the Charts</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Distribution of Dead Spells Chart:</strong> This bar chart displays the fraction of simulations (for
        each turn) that resulted in a given number of dead spells, ignoring cases where there were zero dead spells.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Dead Spells by Missing Color Chart:</strong> This line chart shows, turn by turn, how many spells on
        average
        are uncastable specifically because they need a color pip the available lands do not provide (even though there
        are enough
        total lands to pay the cost).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Turns Spent Dead in Hand:</strong> This chart shows for each non-land spell how many turns it lingered
        uncastable in your hand before you had sufficient mana to cast it for the first time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disclaimer about Simplification of Real MTG Games</h3>
<p>
    This simulation focuses solely on mana availability. Real Magic gameplay involves far more factors such as
    triggered abilities, synergy, additional card draws, side strategies, etc. The simulator is simply a
    rough guideline for how frequently your spells end up uncastable due to mana issues.
