<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>
    Fill in the simulation settings on the left. Then, paste your deck list in the provided text area. The deck list
    should include a "Deck" section (which will be simulated) and a "Sideboard" section (which will be ignored).
    Finally, click “Run simulation” to see the results.
</p>

<p>
    To get your deck list from 17lands, click on the "Deck Export" button from the deck view and
    select "Copy as plain text" and then paste it here.
</p>

<h3>How the simulation works</h3>
<p>
    The simulation runs many iterations of a simplified game scenario. For each simulation:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Your deck list is parsed and each card is converted to its mana requirements and production capabilities.</li>
    <li>A deck is built, shuffled, and cards are drawn turn by turn (depending on whether you are on the play or draw).
    </li>
    <li>Each turn, the simulation determines which spells are castable based on the available sources. Any spells that
        cannot be cast are considered “dead” for that turn.</li>
    <li>If a spell is within the total mana available but missing certain colored sources, it is counted as “dead
        because of missing color pips.”</li>
    <li>These data are aggregated over many simulations and summarized in charts and statistics.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key Assumptions</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fixed Turn Structure:</strong> We simulate a fixed number of turns with a fixed draw pattern.</li>
    <li><strong>One Mana per Land or Source:</strong> Each land or producing card provides exactly one mana, chosen from
        among its producible colors.</li>
    <li><strong>Simplified Casting:</strong> We assume you can access the maximum potential of your lands each turn for
        any spells that could be cast.</li>
    <li><strong>No Re-check after Castable:</strong> Once a normal spell is deemed castable, it is assumed to remain
        castable thereafter.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interpreting the Key Statistics</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>% of Turns with 0 Dead Spells:</strong> This statistic shows the proportion of simulated turns in which
        every spell drawn so far could be cast with the available mana and mana-producing spells castable on prior
        turns.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Expected Dead Spells per Turn:</strong> This is the average number of spells per turn that are “dead”
        (i.e. not castable).
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Interpreting the Charts</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Distribution of Dead Spells:</strong> Shows how frequently each number of dead spells (1,2,3,...) occurs
        on each turn.</li>
    <li><strong>Dead Spells by Missing Color:</strong> Shows how many spells on average are uncastable each turn because
        they lack specific color sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Turns Spent Dead:</strong> For each spell, how many turns it remained in hand before first becoming
        castable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Simplification of Real MTG Games</h3>
<p>
    This simulation focuses solely on mana availability and the ability to cast spells. It does not capture many of the
    complexities of real Magic. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It does not consider card abilities such as card draw, cycling, tutoring, graveyard synergies, exhaust
        abilities, etc.</li>
    <li>It does not account for the Arena Bo1 hand smoother, or your mulligan choices</li>
    <li>We aren't simulating anything related to gameplay (this is just about greedy use of mana).</li>
    <li>Any spell that could be used to produce mana in the future is cast as soon as it is playable.</li>
    <li>A card is considered castable if it would have been possible to cast it given the mana sources you have, even if
        you have other competing uses for that mana.</li>
    <li>It doesn't consider the value of holding onto a card for a future turn.</li>
    <li>It is able to make perfect decisions about what lands to have played in prior turns in order to maximize the
        ability to cast any given spell on this turn.</li>
    <li>We aren't keeping track of any affinity cost reductions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    So, in general, think about this is the most <i>optimistic</i> scenario for spending your mana.</li>
