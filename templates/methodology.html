<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>
    Fill in the simulation settings on the left (deck size, initial hand size, number of draw steps, number of
    simulations, and random seed). Then, paste your deck list in the provided text area. The deck list should include
    a "Deck" section (which will be simulated) and a "Sideboard" section (which will be ignored).
    Finally, click “Run simulation” to start the simulation and view the results and charts on the right.
</p>

<p>
    To get your deck list from 17lands, click on the "Deck Export" button from the deck view and
    select "Copy as plain text" and then paste into this app accordingly.
</p>

<h3>How the simulation works</h3>
<p>
    The simulation runs many iterations of a simplified game scenario. For each simulation:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Your deck list is parsed and each card name is converted to its mana requirements and production capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>For each simulation run, a deck is built from the parsed deck list and shuffled.</li>
    <li>For each turn in the simulation, the hand size increases (depending on “on play” or “on draw” rules), and the
        simulation
        checks which spells are “dead” (i.e. not castable) based on mana producing cards (lands or cards that tap for
        mana) that could have been played this turn or on previous turns.</li>
    <li>The app also tests single-color land replacements to see which color would best reduce dead spells on that turn.
    </li>
    <li>Results are aggregated across simulations and displayed as summary statistics and charts.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key Assumptions in the Simulation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Fixed Turn Structure:</strong> The simulation assumes a fixed number of turns and a set increase in hand
        size (depending on “on play” or “on draw” rules).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>One Mana per Land:</strong> Each land or mana-producing source is assumed to provide exactly one mana
        per turn.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Simplified Casting:</strong> The simulation uses a basic algorithm to determine if a spell can be cast,
        checking combinations of available mana sources without simulating more complex in‐game interactions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>No Re-check for Known Castables:</strong> Once a normal spell is deemed castable in a previous turn, it
        is assumed to remain castable in later turns without further checks.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Interpreting the Key Statistics</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>% of Turns with 0 Dead Spells:</strong> This statistic shows the proportion of simulated turns in which
        every spell drawn could be cast.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Expected Dead Spells per Turn:</strong> This is the average number of spells per turn that are “dead”
        (i.e. not castable).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Most Desired Pip Color:</strong> The color which, if used to replace a land, most frequently resulted in
        fewer dead spells.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Least Desired Pip Color:</strong> Among the colors present in your deck, the one that least improved the
        situation when swapped in.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Read the Charts</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Distribution of Dead Spells Chart:</strong> This bar chart displays the fraction of simulations (for
        each turn) that resulted in a given number of dead spells, ignoring cases where there were zero dead spells.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Best Color to Replace a Land Chart:</strong> This line chart shows, turn by turn, the percentage of
        simulations where switching a land to a specific color would have been most beneficial in reducing dead spells.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Simplification of Real MTG Games</h3>
<p>
    This simulation focuses solely on mana availability and the ability to cast spells. It does not capture many of the
    complexities of real Magic. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It does not consider card abilities such as card draw, cycling, tutoring, exhaust abilities, etc.</li>
    <li>We aren't simulating anything related to gameplay (this is just about greedy use of mana).</li>
    <li>A card is considered castable if it would have been possible to cast it given the mana sources you have, even if
        you have other competing uses for that mana.</li>
    <li>It doesn't consider the value of holding onto a card for a future turn.</li>
    <li>It is able to make perfect decisions about what lands to have played in prior turns in order to maximize the
        ability to cast any given spell on this turn.</li>
    <li>We aren't keeping track of any affinity cost reductions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    So, in general, think about this is the most <i>optimistic</i> scenario for spending your mana.</li>
