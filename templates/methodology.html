<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>
    Fill in the simulation settings on the left. Then, paste your deck list in the provided text area. The deck list
    should include a "Deck" section (which will be simulated) and a "Sideboard" section (which will be ignored).
    Finally, click “Run simulation” to see the results.
</p>

<p>
    To get your deck list from 17lands, click on the "Deck Export" button from the deck view and
    select "Copy as plain text" and then paste it here.
</p>

<h3>How the simulation works</h3>
<p>
    The simulation runs many iterations of a simplified game scenario. For each simulation:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Your deck list is parsed and each card is converted to its mana requirements and production capabilities.</li>
    <li>A deck is built, shuffled, and cards are drawn turn by turn (depending on whether you are on the play or draw).
    </li>
    <li>Each turn, the simulation determines which spells are castable based on the available sources. Any spells that
        cannot be cast are considered “dead” for that turn.</li>
    <li>If a spell is within the total mana available but missing certain colored sources, it is counted as “dead
        because of missing color pips.”</li>
    <li>These data are aggregated over many simulations and summarized in charts and statistics.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key Assumptions</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fixed Turn Structure:</strong> We simulate a fixed number of turns with a fixed draw pattern.</li>
    <li><strong>One Mana per Land or Source:</strong> Each land or producing card provides exactly one mana, chosen from
        among its producible colors.</li>
    <li><strong>Simplified Casting:</strong> We assume you can access the maximum potential of your lands each turn for
        any spells that could be cast.</li>
    <li><strong>No Re-check after Castable:</strong> Once a normal spell is deemed castable, it is assumed to remain
        castable thereafter.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interpreting the Charts</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Distribution of Dead Spells:</strong> Shows how frequently each number of dead spells (1,2,3,...) occurs
        on each turn.</li>
    <li><strong>Dead Spells by Missing Color:</strong> Shows how many spells on average are uncastable each turn because
        they lack specific color sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Turns Spent Dead:</strong> For each spell, how many turns it remained in hand before first becoming
        castable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disclaimer on Simplification</h3>
<p>
    This simulator focuses primarily on mana availability. It does not capture the complexity of real gameplay, where
    additional interactions and effects can alter the number of available cards and resources. Think of these results
    as a rough guideline for how often you might be unable to cast your spells due to mana constraints.
